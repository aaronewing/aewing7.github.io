# HTML/CSS/JS SBA: FitLy
## Created By Aaron Ewing

### INTRODUCTION:

This project is the basic outline for a fitness app. It has a landing page where you can sign-in or log-in. A home page where you can select your next page. Currently, the only working page is the about me. This was done to keep the project simple while hitting all the requirements.

This project was created as the skeleton page for what is going to be my capstone project. Things will change and look different when it is submitted for the capstone but I used this SBA has a chance to get ahead/get a concept of what I want my capstone pages to look like or what functionality I might add. Below, you will find a how to use the page.


### HOW TO USE:

index.html (the main page) has 2 buttons, a sign-in or sign-up. Right now these pages dont reference or store log-in information so you can choose either one to get to the homepage. Just enter a valid email and a password that has more than 6 characters.

home.html is the landing page. It has a working navbar and buttons you can click. Currently, the only clickable button is the about page which will bring you to about.html

about.html has general information about me (placeholder information). It also has a contact form that allows you to input your name, email and message. You can only enter in one email per session (which is right now reset on a refresh). Below, I have the requirements and where they can be seen/found on the page and in the code.
